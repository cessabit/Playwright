//we have to import required modules (@playwright/test) to access the feature and functionality for testing
//test and expect are 2 packages required from this module, test is for testig and expect is for validation

//async keyword will make a fn return a promise
//await keyword will make a fn wait for a promise 
//a Promise represents an asynchronous operation that will either be completed successfully (resolved) or fail

//for eg in the below await statement it will wait to execute until async {page} is loaded completely i,e return a promise
// spec.js file commonly used to indicate that the file contains test specifications (automated test cases written using Playwrightâ€™s testing framework)
// page fixture giving you access to a new browser page in each test.
